Analyze the provided syllabus and perform the following tasks:

1. Scan the syllabus to identify all important topics.

2. For each important topic, evaluate:
   a) Time required to study the topic
   b) Importance on a scale of 1-10
   c) Number of subtopics
   d) Difficulty level on a scale of 1-10

3. Generate a JSON object with the following structure for each important topic:

{
  "topic_name": {
    "time": "estimated time to cover the topic",
    "importance": "importance score (1-10)",
    "subtopics": "number of subtopics",
    "difficulty": "difficulty score (1-10)"
  },
  "another_topic_name": {
    "time": "estimated time to cover the topic",
    "importance": "importance score (1-10)",
    "subtopics": "number of subtopics",
    "difficulty": "difficulty score (1-10)"
  }
}

Notes:
- Provide time estimates in hours or days (e.g., "2 hours" or "3 days")
- Importance and difficulty scores should be integers from 1 to 10
- The number of subtopics should be an integer
- Include all important topics from the syllabus in the JSON object
- The output should be strictly in JSON format with no additional text

Please analyze the provided syllabus and return the resulting JSON object based on these instructions.
